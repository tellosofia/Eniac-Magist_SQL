This is the first case study that was presented to us to solve during the Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School. The goal is to know: **Should ENIAC work with MAGIST?**; let's first talk about these companies.

### **ENIAC**
Eniac, a Spanish-founded online marketplace, specializes in Apple-compatible accessories. Established a decade ago, Eniac has expanded to neighboring countries, offering a wide range of products at competitive prices. The company's core values center around providing friendly and professional tech support while maintaining a warm, customer-oriented approach.

Post going public, Eniac faces the challenge of scaling up while preserving its human touch, a fundamental aspect of the company's identity. Despite investor pressure, the company's average monthly revenue stands at €1.17 million, with an average order price of €710 and an average item price of €540.

### **Magist**
Eniac, looking to expand into the Brazilian market, encounters a challenge due to a lack of local connections and market knowledge. Despite the board's one-year expansion demand, the company faces obstacles in forming ties with local providers, delivery services, and customer support agencies.

Enter Magist, a Brazilian Software as a Service company specializing in a centralized order management system for small to medium-sized stores within major Brazilian marketplaces. Magist not only facilitates after-sales services like inventory management, product shipment, and customer service related to shipping but also provides access to cost-effective contracts with marketplaces and the Post Office, reducing fees and administrative hurdles.

While Eniac operates its European e-commerce directly, it aims to establish a presence in Brazil by potentially engaging Magist through a 3-year intermediate agreement. This move allows Eniac to test the market, build brand recognition, and explore setting up its supply chain management. (Note that Magist differs from e-commerce platforms like Amazon or eBay. Eniac will continue selling its products in Brazil through its own website and brand.)

However, **some concerns arise within Eniac regarding the compatibility of Magist's services with Eniac's high-end tech product line and the speed of deliveries**, essential for customer satisfaction. This is what we're supposed to find out through an analysis of Magist's database.
